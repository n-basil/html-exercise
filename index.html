        <h3> Cities I Have Lived In  </h3>
        <p>
            I grew up in Quakertown and stayed there until I graduated high school
            where we then moved to Greentown. I was only there for a short bit before
            I went off to college in West Point, NY. I did my four years of school
            there before I went to Augusta, GA for Basic Officer Leaders Course
            for the Army. I was there for about half a year before I moved to
            Fayetteville for my first duty station at Fort Bragg.

        <h3> Cities I Would Like to Visit</h3>
        <p>
            I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture and food so I think it'd be very fun to visit Tokyo. As for Italy, 
            my Dad's side is from there so it would be neat to go (as I have already been to England for my Mom's side). Lastly,
            I have always been interested in Ancient Greek culture and history so Athens would also be an awesome place to visit.
